      I am Ibekwe Emmanuel, an “ALTSCHOOLER” currently studying Back-end
      Engineering at AltSchool Africa. The Spark of Curiosity ever since I first
      laid my hands on a computer captivated my interest as I pondered the magic
      that happens behind the scenes. I used to wonder how computers functioned
      not to talk of how websites and mobile applications came alive. This
      curiosity was the initial spark that ignited my passion for Tech in
      general and back-end engineering in particular as I long to become a "Tech
      Bro". My journey into Tech and subsequently into back-end engineering
      dates back to 2018 when I began learning graphics design, grappling with a
      melange of the basics of Adobe Creative suite and my undergraduate
      program. Subsequently, I enrolled in a computer science course as I was
      determined to unravel the mysteries of how computers operate. It wasn't
      long before I realized that my quest had reached new heights when I
      started developing an interest in using tools like Figma to design user
      interfaces while ensuring feasible user experiences are applied in my
      designs. I felt I had already created an application after I created and
      prototyped my first UI/UX design which was a Fintech app "Moniee". It felt
      so good to have achieved this but the highest I could do was to create a
      prototype for this app. Thus, it wasn’t like every other mobile
      application like PayPal and the like. What I did not know was that these
      prototypes would undergo a process called programming or coding for them
      to come alive. Employing my UI/UX skills in some jobs given to me by
      clients helped me realize the entire process that went into creating a
      complete website and mobile application. This sparked my interest in
      software engineering as I developed an interest in enhancing my tech
      skills of not just designing user interfaces but also bringing these
      designs to life so as to solve users’ problems. Furthermore, I started
      learning gradually from YouTube and some other platforms that were
      resourceful. With each line of code I wrote, I felt like I was piecing
      together the puzzle of digital existence and architecting the backbone of
      digital experiences. I was drawn to the idea of creating robust and
      efficient systems that power the front-end interfaces people interact with
      daily.

    <h1>My Reasons For Choosing Back-end Engineering And What I Aim To Achieve</h1>
    <p>
      The reason I chose back-end engineering is simple: I wanted to try
      something new and more tasking. To be the unseen architect of the digital
      world. While front-end developers craft the user interface, I aspire to
      build the infrastructure that supports and enhances those experiences.
      It's the backbone of technology, and I wanted to be at the heart of Tech.
      My journey into back-end engineering is guided by a set of ambitious
      goals. I want to master the technicalities of databases, optimize server
      performance, and ensure data security. I aspire to create systems that can
      seamlessly handle a great deal of requests, making websites and
      applications run smoothly even in the face of immense traffic. My goal
      isn't just to be a back-end engineer; it's to leave a lasting mark on the
      digital landscape. I dream of creating software that empowers businesses
      and enriches the lives of users. Whether it's a robust e-commerce
      platform, a scalable social network, or a cutting-edge mobile application,
      I want my work to be the backbone of innovation. Consequently, my journey
      into back-end engineering is only beginning, but I'm excited to dive
      deeper into the realm of data structures, algorithms, and distributed
      systems. With each line of code I write and every challenge I overcome, I
      believe that I am one step closer to realizing my dream of becoming a
      back-end engineer. Everyone may not always see my work, but they will
      undoubtedly feel its impact. This is what I aspire to achieve.
